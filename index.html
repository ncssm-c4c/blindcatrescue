    <h2>Welcome to the official web page for Blind Cat Rescue & Sanctuary, Inc</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We are a lifetime cat care sanctuary located in St. Pauls, North Carolina (USA).</p>
    <p>In 2005, we built our first building as a safe place for blind cats who were deemed not adoptable by regular shelters and were going to be euthanized because they were blind. In 2011, we built a second shelter to provide a safe place for Leukemia
      positive (FELV+) and Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV+) cats who otherwise would be killed because they tested positive for these viruses.</p>
    <p>We are a registered non-profit 501©3 in the state of North Carolina. Our tax identification number is 20-3410498. Your donations are tax-deductible, encrypted,and safe.</p>

    <p style="width: 48%; float: right">Charity came to us from a local rescuer after being rescued off of the porch of a man who “hates cats.”
      <br><br> The rescuer called us requesting help because of the horrible condition she was in. They felt they were in way over their heads. You may see her BEFORE picture HERE (warning, very graphic) Charity immediately received the medical care she
      needed. Because of wonderful generous people like YOU she is alive and healthy being loved and cared for at Blind Cat Rescue. When you donate, you help a cat like Charity that was desperate for help.</p>
